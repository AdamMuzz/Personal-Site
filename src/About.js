			<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<div>
				{/* image of myself & bio */}
				<p>
					I'm currently a 2nd year Computer Science major at UCLA, with plans to double major in Business Economics.
					Within the realm of CS, I'm very interested in UI/UX design and AI fields.
					Aside from coding, business is my passion.
					My good friend and I co-founded a startup called Bartr which aims to create a localized trading platform for college students to promote and facilitate meeting new people and other neighborly activities.
					Building a business from the ground up is an exciting and rewarding experience that I hope to incorporate into my future career, as it allows me to use my love for coding, business, and design in a productive and meaningful way.
					Outside of academics, I'm an avid home chef, love to workout, and am a passionate retail investor.
					I especially love cooking breakfast, and consider myself in the top 1% of omelet makers worldwide.
